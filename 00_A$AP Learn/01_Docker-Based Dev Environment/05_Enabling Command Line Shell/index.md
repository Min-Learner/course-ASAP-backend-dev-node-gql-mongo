### Set Up a Proper Shell 

Those who worked in Unix-like systems exclusively know how to use Terminal and Shell - your command line environment. As the containers used in this course run Linux, you'll have the shell access to them via the `docker exec` command, actually "executing" the `bash`. 

In Windows, the "Command Prompt" used to be the terminal equivalent, since the DOS days. However, not everyone may be aware of the ["PowerShell"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/getting-started/getting-started-with-windows-powershell?view=powershell-6) functionality. If you are on Windows, install and configure the latest version of PowerShell and use it as the terminal. It even understands some Unix commands.
