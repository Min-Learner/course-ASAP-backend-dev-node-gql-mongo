### Building you Developer Cockpit

Professional Front End developers are always pictured sitting in front of multiple monitors - at least two or three. When working with multi-component systems, multiple monitors is a necessity, not a luxury. Same applies to backend dev work, and, be honest with yourself, at some point you'll work on developing front ends too, or at least test your backend using browsers.

Lack of the proper workplace (learnplace) setup *will* hinder your progress. As you've heard and seen, there is a huge push in the eLearning industry to fit as much information as possible on a tiniest screen so that folks can study on their cell phones. Admit, this has very little to do with the *professional* IT learning. You'll learn by doing, and you will do the work in a *professional* setup, with multiple systems and code editors running. You'll need screens to display all that stuff on, so that you can see the environment acting as a whole and modify components of it easily and effectively. Just like when you work as a professional dev.

You'll also need a screen area to display this course while you follow the course material in the actual editors and consoles. 

Multi-monitor setup may not be trivial, and if you don't have the hardware to support it - it won't happen. Our days, an average laptop comes with a `Mini DisplayPort™` or `HDMI™`, or both. You may be able to plug in a monitor via USB-to-HDMI Adaptor. On the monitor side, you can plug in a Wireless WiFi Display Receiver and link to the monitor via your laptop's wireless card. So there are options to work with. At a minimum, have one external display on your desk to add to the laptop's one. Get a good comfortable mouse too.


Once your cockpit is set up, your journey will be faster and more pleasant!
