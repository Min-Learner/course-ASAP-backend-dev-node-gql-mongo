### Assuming, You Are a Legacy Backend Dev

Someone who spent a few years working in IT with a general focus on backend technologies, has a grasp of the following concepts:

- Computer Operating System concepts: CPU, Memory, Ports, File System and I/O
- Communication Protocols: TCP, HTTP, HTTPS
- Operating Systems Command Line, User, Group, Terminal, Shell
- Machine Environment Variables
- Program structure and components: variables, statements, functions, objects
- Program runtime: launch, input, output, logging, daemon mode
- Special formats: JSON, YAML
- Database: tables, columns, rows, indexes, data load and extract operations
- Standard software packaging, versioning and distribution

The reality is that the Software Industry is a highly applied (skills-based vs. theory-focused) field, so the knowledge of concepts doesn't make a person a marketable developer. However, once the concepts are matched with their implementation in a specific system - everything falls in place for a capable individual to become professionally productive in that system fast.

This course will make a legacy dev productive in modern backends in a matter of hours!
