### NodeJS-MongoDB Backend Stack Superpower for a Business App 

A huge advantage using NodeJS-MongoDB stack as the backend for a general business application is its processing power to complexity ratio: you get an infinitely scalable, full-feature modern server at a minimal implementation and maintenance complexity. Yet, there is nothing particularly special about the stack - its power is created by containerized deployment technologies and focus on common usability vs.over-theorized software architecture models.

- **NodeJS: use of the entire processing capacity of the runtime environment.** Unlike some frameworks designed to manage the entire backend server process, NodeJS simply runs a single-threaded non-blocking process that can use as much CPU and memory as the runtime operating system environment makes available to it. No tuning of the number of "workers" or "threads" - the scalability is handled at the level of the runtime machine instances, which is what the cloud systems can do best: if the use of memory or CPU on instances running the server gets over some threshold, the cloud spins up more instances. Likewise, low usage instances get shutdown when the demand decreases.

- **JavaScript and TypeScript: write only the necessary code.** Modern JavaScript with asynchronous functions enables writing clear and easy to follow code. TypeScript is an important add-on when developing larger applications with many components and objects to manage 

- **Mongoose: simple and concise Data Access Layer.** It makes No-SQL data access API structured enough to reflect the data models in the program code, yet without isolating the code from data completely by a fully-generic layer found in some frameworks.

- **MongoDB: fast, flexible, simple business data management system.** It has the tools for efficient data storage and retrieval, yet it assumes that the business process flow and the business software implementation layer can take care of data consistency and model, so it doesn't impose its own rules on what that should be, therefore leaving the freedom of defining the data completely to the outside systems

This course will outline the simple principals, explain and teach you the exact steps of building a backend application, more powerful than anything you might have coded before, in a matter of hours
