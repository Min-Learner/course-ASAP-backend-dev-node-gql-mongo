### NodeJS-MongoDB Backend Stack Superpower for Business Applications 

The goal of this course is to help you making the leap from legacy backend development (anything that's been around for roughly 10-plus years) to developing in a modern and popular stack that is super-powerful - when implemented correctly.

Right implementation approach is the key here. Someone making a feature-to-feature comparison between NodeJS-MongoDB stack and legacy marvels may say that there is no way the stack can handle anything worthwhile - it just seems too weak, like a toy. The truth is that in the Cloud Era, the power of stack is the power of its cloud-based deployment. Legacy marvels can run in the cloud (anything can!), but they don't take advantage of the cloud at the level the NodeJS-MongoDB stack does. Legacy stuff has been developed under concepts conflicting with how the cloud works. Legacy systems *fight* the cloud to do the work themselves. NodeJS-MongoDB *fits* in the cloud and lets the cloud do the hard lifting for it.

A core advantage of using NodeJS-MongoDB stack as the backend for a modern business application is its power-to-complexity ratio: you get an infinitely scalable, full-featured modern server at a low implementation and maintenance complexity. Keep-it-simple at its best.

Let's quickly define the components of the stack and the special things about them:

- **NodeJS: use of full processing capacity of the runtime environment.** Unlike the legacy frameworks designed to micro-manage the backend server capacity, NodeJS is a single-threaded non-blocking process that uses as much CPU and memory as the operating system environment makes available to it. No tuning of the number of "workers" or "threads" - the scalability is handled at the machine level, which is exactly what the cloud systems do best: machine power is added when the load is high and reduced when the load is low

- **JavaScript and TypeScript: write only the necessary code.** Modern JavaScript with asynchronous functions enables writing clear and easy to follow code. TypeScript is an important add-on bringing the order necessary when developing large applications with many components and objects to manage 

- **Mongoose: simple and concise Data Access Layer.** Mongoose makes MongoDB No-SQL data access API structured enough to reflect the data models in the program code, yet without isolating the code from data by some proprietary layer within the framework

- **MongoDB: fast, flexible, simple business data management system.** MongoDB has excellent tools for efficient data storage and retrieval, yet it trusts the external systems to own the business side of the implementation: the data models, consistency and integrity, passing the key power into the business software developer's hands

So, is NodeJS-MongoDB the ultimate solution for business software backend development for many years to come? Absolutely not! If anything, the software lifecycles accelerate, and things like *serverless* technologies have already grown from concepts to running implementations. What does it mean for a developer? The survival and prosperity strategy should not be to sit around, buried in *legacy*, waiting for *"what's next"*. The *"next"* always changes, so - get on and run with what's *current*, get ready for the *next current*, and then for *next current*, again and again.

This course shows you how *easy* it is to learn a technology that is *relatively* different from what an IT professional working with 20-th century tools is used to. The keys to succeed in this learning:

- make sure to understand *why* things are done the way they are done. *How* is easy, *why* is smart. Don't skip over the *why* and ask for help if the course material falls short explaining things to your satisfaction
- work to build a simple understanding of the concepts before diving into deep theory. This course *does not* cover the *theory*, it focuses on the *practical* use and value of the tools. If you are interested in the theory - be honest with yourself: are you in the right line of business? Sure, deep understanding of things helps a lot. However, realistically, the body of IT knowledge is growing too fast for a field developer having a chance to learn all the theory and still deliver the practice across these many evolving skills
- work to improve the speed of your learning - from the moment you first read about a technology till completing your first meaningful implementation of it. Back to the point immediately above: in the flood of technologies it's about staying afloat, not about diving into the depths
